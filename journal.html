<h1>My English Class Journal</h1>


<h2>Welcome,</h2>
<h2>Through this site, I would like to share my English writing as I improve my coding skills. Soon I will be correcting errors and posting new entries based on my thoughts while living my everyday adventures. These can go from learning and college to lifestyle and hobbies, or even sometimes, all of them altogether.</h2>
<h2>-Susana Cruz</h2>

<h1>First Entry</h1>
<h3>September 4, 2018</h3>
<h2>There is a very popular phrase that says “today is the first day of the rest of your life”. Even though it sounds as it came right out of a commercial, I love how it applies to the fact that any choices you make today can influence the course of the following days.
When I look around the rooms that I spend the most time in now, I stop and remind myself of how my own choices are what got me here. And every now and then, I will be a little proud that this is the environment in which I have felt fulfilled the longest, and I know it is going to remain like that.
</h2>
<h2>However, not many ideas flow when I try to talk about my satisfying everyday, or express myself about the many things that make me happy today. I blame that on the strange fact we like to focus mostly on the things that are out of place in our lives. That’s why I will begin writing about the time I went through before everything was so clear, and I had a very blurry view of my future.
</h2>
<h2>I graduated from Colegio Campestre Americano, the same school I had been going to since the beginning of elementary school, which made it very hard to say goodbye when that stage of my life was over. This place was more of a home to me, and I don’t only say it because I was full of school pride, I mean it. CCA was the place where I learned the most valuable things, where I went through struggles, and most importantly, where I grew emotionally. Even though school was the place where I got stressed the most, it was also where I would find the most shelter at times. By the end, I realized that the sense of belonging I felt for that school was even bigger than the one I felt for my own house. Because of all of that, I do not hesitate to establish that until the age of 16, this institution was my whole life.
</h2>
<h2>My mind was blank when I tried to picture a future after graduating, to me, that was a myth. Just like many students, I was terrified that time was running out until I had to make a choice that would change the rest of my life, and it was a choice nobody else would make for me. But there was an aspect in which I could not relate to many people I knew, and that was the fact of having a very broad spectrum of ideas about what I wanted to do in the future, but none of them was concrete. I guess this is the point when parents get worried about their kids having no direction, which just adds more weigh to the choice-making process.
</h2>
<h2>In my way to making these choices,  I experienced a lot of frustration; I felt like I carried the burdens of an adult and I had all the limitations of a kid. After I hit rock bottom because of drowning in that pressure, I learned that it was time for me to speak up and make my own decisions, leaving behind all the judgement from the people around me, and letting go of all the expectations that I was trying to meet.
</h2>
<h2>That was how I finally figured out my college plan, after almost a year of longing to have the security that most people seem to have when they go to college. Today, it is very rewarding to look back and realize how all the unfortunate events of the past year and all my frustrations were necessary to improve as a person, and make myself more prepared for the challenges that life in college had and will continue to have for me. To be honest, I still get a little nostalgic when I remember the old days in high school, but I have finally reached the level when I can just smile thinking of it as my beginning, knowing that I now get to see much more of the big world that we live in. A world that I may have known existed, but had not yet opened my eyes to.</h2>
